Directly across the street you will see Speare Hall, once the site of the Boston Opera House.<br/<br/>While not a jazz venue per se, The Boston Opera House hosted many jazz events in its relatively short tenure on Huntington Ave. Opened in 1909 and touted as another jewel in Boston’s crown of the arts along with Symphony Hall and The Boston Public Library, it was the home of the Boston Opera Company who were arch competitors of New York’s Metropolitan Opera Company. When the Boston Opera Company went bankrupt in 1915, the venue began hosting events by other companies (including the Met) and even made forays into popular music and theater. It was during these later years that the Opera House saw many jazz events on its stage including the world premiere of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Ellington">Duke Ellington</a>’s afro-centric retelling of The Beggars Opera, a classic satire from the 18th century. While Ellington’s musical (entitled <a href="https://www.troystreet.com/tspots/2013/12/06/dec-6-1946-the-mavericks-in-twilight-alley/">Twilight Alley</a>, aka Beggar’s Holiday) was not well received by critics, it featured an impressive cast and crew including director <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002144/">John Houseman</a> and actor <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0609216">Zero Mostel</a> and was revolutionary for its day in casting African-American actors in the lead roles and featuring an inter-racial romance at the heart of the story.<div class="iframe-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UZlUEpANShA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>Other popular stars such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Robinson">Bill “Bojangles” Robinson</a> and <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Sidney-Bechet">Sidney Bechet</a> made appearances throughout the thirties and forties but the Opera House eventually fell into disuse and disrepair and was demolished in the 1950s. All that remains today is the street name Opera Place which runs from Huntington Avenue along the east wall of Speare Hall.</p>',

            description: '<h2>New England Conservatory of Music</h2>Heading east (or “inbound” as the say on the “T”), at the corner of Huntington and Gainsborough, we find Northeastern\’s closest neighbor, The New England Conservatory of Music.<br/><br/>Founded in 1867, <a href="https://necmusic.edu/">The New England Conservatory of Music</a> originally focused only on classical music and presented a curriculum based on the conservatories of Europe. By the 1940s, it was clear that there was a need to educate musicians working in “popular” genres along with classical and symphonic disciplines so the Department of Popular Music was formed in 1942 (although they were careful to leave out the word “jazz”). The new program strived to strengthen skills such as practical theory, sight reading, arranging and transposition in musicians who may not have developed through a traditional musical training system. From 1955 to 1965, the department was run by Northeastern alumni, musician, and educator, William Tesson [DATE], who then returned to Northeastern and applied his modern methods to NU\’s concert band, jazz band, choral program and pep band as director of the <a href="https://web.northeastern.edu/pepband/index.php/about">NU Band Association</a>.<br/><br/>In the 1960s, the Department of Popular Music was given another boost when famed musician and composer <a href="https://necmusic.edu/archives/gunther-schuller">Gunther Schiller</a> became president of NEC. Schiller was a classical musician who had also recorded with jazz greats such as Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie, and Frank Sinatra and had devised a musical theory combining the disciplines of both classical and jazz dubbed “third stream” music. <br/><br/>During this time, the NEC also spearheaded the revival of Scott Joplin and many other neglected african-american composers from the early years of jazz, preserving--and performing--the music for later generations.<br/><div class="iframe-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7AY-uI1BuDs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>',

The Paul Whiteman orchestra presented a series of “symphonic jazz’ concerts here in the 1920s in an attempt to make the new music more palatable to conservative audiences. <div class="iframe-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ng8QDwkKZsU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>Later, during the swing era, the seats at the front of the hall were removed to accommodate dancing to the music of Count Basie, Jimmie Lunceford, Benny Goodman and other hard swinging outfits. In a nod to egalitarianism, many of these jazz performances were set on Thursday nights—-traditionally the servant\’s night off in Boston. In January 1943, Duke Ellington presented one of only three complete performances of his landmark Black, Brown, and Beige Symphony, a “tone parallel to the history of the American Negro”.<br/><br/>Since 1885, Boston Pops program has brought popular music into the classical setting and even offers a little jazz on occasion.',

Ave. heading towards Columbus.<br/><br/>Until 1970, the American Federation of Musicians was racially segregated and maintained two separate chapters in Boston: Local 9 for whites and Local 535 for blacks. Black musicians had actually lobbied for this separation as the original charter—while in theory looking out for the interests of all members, regardless of race—in practice restricted black musicians to lower paying dance and jazz work while the whites received the bulk of the lucrative commercial, symphonic, and ballroom bookings. After a few temporary moves, (including a short stint upstairs from Charlie’s Sandwich Shoppe at 429 Columbus Ave.) the new AFM Local 535 moved to its permanent home at 409 Mass Ave. in 1939. The building housed rehearsal rooms, meeting halls and space for networking and job postings.<br/><br/> While having a dedicated local helped in addressing the needs of black musicians and allowed a more targeted allocation of resources, segregation of work opportunities was always an issue.<br/><br/>Eventually, the American Federation of Musicians ordered the unions in Boston to merge and in 1970 they formed AFM Local 9-535 closing the Mass. Ave. location and  moving all operations to 56 St. Boltoph St. where the white AFM Local 9 had their union hall.</p>',

Real camaraderie, like you say...That’s where you met musicians and people and got gigs. We got all our own work, ’cause there was still plenty of places where we played, in and outside of Boston, all over the state. “<span class="byline"> - Charles Walker AFM 535</span></p><p class="quote">“I came here in ’45 and first thing, ’cause I’m from North Carolina, I was surprised there were separate unions in Boston. [W]hat existed was they had clubs where only black played and places where only white played... We couldn’t work Blimstrom’s, we knew that, they could never hire, or do the circus or anything. So it was more of less zoned off. Black people worked this club and white people worked that club. Simple as that.”<span class="byline">- Andy McGhee AFM 535</span></p></div>',
