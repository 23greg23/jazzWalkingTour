            description: '<h2>Flamingo Room (1939-194?)</h2><br/>The short lived Flamingo Room was opened 1938 by former speakeasy empresario Jack Levaggi when he consolidated two of his existing clubs (Levaggi’s Downtown (at Hayward Place(?)] and Levaggi’s Uptown [in the Gardner Hotel] into one establishment at the Gardner space and renamed it The Flamingo Room. The small club was expensive (approx. $30 cover charge in today’s dollars) but plush and featured famous national acts such as Woody Herman, the Dorsey Bros. and the Chick Webb Orchestra with Ella Fitzgerald. Poor health forced Levaggi out of the nightclub business in 1940 and the Flamingo Room quickly declined in both the quality and frequency of live music. The building was demolished in 1960 and the site is currently occupied by the Church Park Apartments and retail space. <div id="supplimental">test1234</div>',

            description: '<h2>Roseland-State Ballroom</h2><p>The Roseland-State ballroom (a combination of two earlier, smaller, venues: The  State Ballroom on Mass. Ave. and the Roseland Ballroom on Burbank) was run by brothers Charlie and Cy (Simon) Shribman who ran a string of ballrooms and entertainment complexes across the Northeast. The Shribmans ran an innovative, multi-faceted, business venture that combined the disciplines of booking agents, personal managers, ballroom owners and operators, venture capitalists, and promoters all under one roof.  The Roseland-State building took up the entire block of Mass. Ave between Burbank and Norway Streets and included a bowling alley and a movie theater along with the dancefloor and stage areas. Within the “Ballroom district”, around the intersection of Mass. Ave. and Huntington Ave., the Roseland-State was the biggest and the most popular featuring all the famous national touring acts. Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Jimmie Lunceford, Artie Shaw, Glenn Miller and many more had regular stops here enroute to other engagements within the Shribman entertainment empire.</p><p>Malcom Little (Malcom X) describes the scene when he worked there in the 1940s: “The spotlight would be turning, pink, yellow, green, and blue, picking up the couples lindy-hopping as if they had gone mad. “Wail, man, wail!” people would be shouting at the band; and it would be wailing, until first and then and then another couple just ran out of strength and stumbled off toward the crowd, exhausted and soaked with sweat.”</p><p>Like many venues of the time, the Roseland-State was segregated as the Shribmans feared a backlash and subsequent economic effects if they “broke the code”. While the staff and the entertainment were integrated—with black and white musicians often sharing the stage—audiences were not, with alternating nights for white and black clientele well into the 1950s.</p><p>Cy Shribman died in 1946 as the big band era was beginning to wind down. His brother Charlie kept the ballroom going but shifted priorities to other parts of their entertainment network eventually retiring from the music business by 1960. He retired to Florida and died there in 1976 at the age of 84.3 The block encompassing the Roseland-State was leveled in 1960 and is currently a modern mixed use block containing shops, offices and apartments.</p>',
